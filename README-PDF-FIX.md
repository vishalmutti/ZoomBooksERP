# PDF Processing Fix

This document explains how to fix the CORS issue and image extraction problems with PDF processing in the application.

## What Was Fixed

1. **CORS Configuration**: The server wasn't properly setting CORS headers for all origins. We've simplified the CORS configuration to allow all origins during development.

2. **Module System Mismatch**: The server was using CommonJS syntax but the project is configured for ES modules. We've updated the server code to use ES modules syntax.

3. **Fetch Request Configuration**: The client-side fetch request wasn't properly configured for CORS. We've added a fallback to 'no-cors' mode if regular CORS mode fails.

4. **Timeouts**: The PDF processing was timing out before it could complete. We've increased the timeout values to give it more time to process.

5. **Image Extraction**: The PDF image extraction was hanging indefinitely. We've improved the image extraction process with:
   - Proper timeout protection for each step of the process
   - Better error handling to prevent hanging
   - A fallback mechanism that returns a placeholder if extraction fails
   - Checking for images in the PDF before attempting to render them
   - Processing multiple pages (up to 5) instead of just the first page

## How to Test the Fix

### Option 1: Using the Automated Script (macOS only)

Run the following command to start both the PDF server and the main application:

```bash
./start-app.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup

1. Start the PDF server in one terminal:

```bash
./setup-pdf-server.sh
```

2. Start the main application in another terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open the application in your browser (usually at http://0.0.0.0:5001 or http://localhost:5001)

4. Try uploading a PDF file in the chat interface

### Option 3: Testing Image Extraction Only

To test just the PDF image extraction functionality:

1. Place a PDF file in the `uploads` directory
2. Run the image extraction test script:

```bash
./run-pdf-image-test.sh
```

This will test the improved image extraction functionality and report the results.

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. Check the browser console for detailed logs about the PDF processing flow
2. Check the PDF server terminal for any error messages
3. Make sure both the main application and the PDF server are running
4. For image extraction issues, look for logs containing "image extraction" in the browser console
