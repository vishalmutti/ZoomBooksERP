The error indicates that your code is trying to insert or query from a table named "carriers" that does not exist in your database. In other words, your carriers functionality is referencing a "carriers" table, but you haven't defined (or migrated) that table in your schema.

Here’s what you need to do:

---

### 1. Define the Carriers Table in Your Schema

In your shared/schema.ts file, add a definition for the carriers table. For example:

```ts
import { pgTable, serial, varchar, text, timestamp } from "drizzle-orm/pg-core";

export const carriers = pgTable("carriers", {
  id: serial("id").primaryKey(),
  name: varchar("name", { length: 255 }).notNull(),
  contactInfo: text("contact_info"), // or separate fields if you prefer
  createdAt: timestamp("created_at").defaultNow().notNull(),
});
```

You can add any additional fields you need (e.g., phone, email, address, etc.).

---

### 2. Update Types and Insert Schema

Define the corresponding insert schema and TypeScript types in your shared/schema.ts:

```ts
import { createInsertSchema } from "drizzle-zod";
import { z } from "zod";

export const insertCarrierSchema = createInsertSchema(carriers).omit({
  id: true,
  createdAt: true,
});

export type InsertCarrier = z.infer<typeof insertCarrierSchema>;
export type Carrier = typeof carriers.$inferSelect;
```

---

### 3. Implement Carrier Functions in Your Storage Layer

In your server/storage.ts, add functions to create (and optionally fetch) carriers. For example:

```ts
import { carriers, type InsertCarrier, type Carrier } from "@shared/schema";

// ...

export class DatabaseStorage implements IStorage {
  // ...existing methods...

  async createCarrier(carrier: InsertCarrier): Promise<Carrier> {
    const [newCarrier] = await db.insert(carriers).values(carrier).returning();
    if (!newCarrier) {
      throw new Error("Failed to create carrier");
    }
    return newCarrier;
  }

  async getCarriers(): Promise<Carrier[]> {
    return await db.select().from(carriers).orderBy(carriers.createdAt);
  }
}
```

Also, update your IStorage interface to include these methods if you’re using one.

---

### 4. Run Your Migrations

Once you add the new table definition in your schema, run your migration process (or restart your server if you have auto-migration enabled) so that the "carriers" table is created in your database.

---

### 5. Verify Your API Endpoints and Frontend Query

Make sure that your CarrierForm and CarrierTable components are calling the correct API endpoints (e.g., `/api/carriers`). With the carriers table now defined and the storage functions in place, your POST requests to create a carrier should succeed, and subsequent GET requests should fetch the new carrier data.

---

### Summary

- **Error Cause:** Your application is trying to operate on a "carriers" table that hasn't been defined.
- **Solution:**  
  1. Add a carriers table definition in shared/schema.ts.  
  2. Define the insert schema and types for carriers.  
  3. Implement createCarrier (and getCarriers) functions in your storage layer.  
  4. Run migrations to create the table in your database.
- **Next Steps:**  
  Test by adding a carrier using the CarrierForm; the error should be resolved, and the CarrierTable should update correctly.
