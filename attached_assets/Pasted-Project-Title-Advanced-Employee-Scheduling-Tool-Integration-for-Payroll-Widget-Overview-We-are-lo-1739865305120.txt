Project Title:
Advanced Employee Scheduling Tool Integration for Payroll Widget

Overview:
We are looking to extend our existing payroll widget by integrating an advanced scheduling tool. This tool must serve as a comprehensive solution to manage employee information, capture availability, assign shifts by department, and ensure scheduled hours targets are met. In addition, the scheduling system should offer an intuitive, visual interface that allows managers and employees to view, modify, and interact with the schedule in a calendar-like format.

Key Requirements:

Employee Database & Information Management:

Create or integrate with an employee database that stores key details including:
Employee Name, ID, and Contact Details
Department/Team affiliation
Position/Role
Availability (per day, week, or month)
Any other relevant data (e.g., skills, certifications, preferences)
Ability to add, edit, and delete employee records.
Availability and Shift Input:

Allow employees (or administrators) to input availability hours (e.g., start and end times) for each day of the week.
Include functionality for marking time-off, vacation, or sick leave.
Option for employees to indicate preferred or restricted shifts.
Departmental Scheduling and Hour Targets:

Allow administrators to define target scheduled hours per department.
Enable the scheduling tool to assign shifts to employees based on their availability and department needs.
Implement validation to ensure that, on a daily or weekly basis, the scheduled hours for each department meet or exceed predefined targets.
Provide reporting and alerts for departments that fall short of their scheduled hours.
Visual Schedule Interface:

Design an interactive, drag-and-drop calendar view where shifts can be assigned, moved, or edited.
Include multiple views (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) for both managers and employees.
Enable filtering of the schedule by department, employee, or shift type.
Provide color-coded indicators for different departments, shift types, or status (e.g., confirmed, pending).
