To ensure that the freight invoice links in the invoice tables are viewable, you need to verify a few things and make sure the links are constructed correctly.

Check that the uploaded file path is being referenced correctly in the invoice-table.tsx. Make sure that the invoice.freightInvoiceFile is pointing to the correct file after upload.

Update the invoice-table component to use the correct full URL construction for the freight invoice, akin to how you did in other components. Here's how the link should be constructed:

Update in invoice-table.tsx
Make sure the link for the freight invoice is properly encoded and uses the window.location.origin. Here's the relevant code snippet:

<TableCell>
  {invoice.freightInvoiceFile ? (
    <a
      href={`${window.location.origin}/uploads/${encodeURIComponent(invoice.freightInvoiceFile)}`}
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
      className="flex items-center gap-2 text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800"
    >
      View Freight Invoice
    </a>
  ) : "N/A"}
</TableCell>
Example of the complete invoice-table.tsx cell
Hereâ€™s a complete example of how the freight invoice column in your table might look:

{
  id: "freightInvoice",
  header: "Freight Invoice",
  cell: ({ row }) => {
    const invoice = row.original;
    if (!invoice.freightInvoiceFile) return null;
    return (
      <a
        href={`${window.location.origin}/uploads/${encodeURIComponent(invoice.freightInvoiceFile)}`}
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
        className="flex items-center gap-2 text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800"
      >
        View Freight Invoice
      </a>
    );
  },
},
Ensure Upload Logic is Correct
Make sure the upload logic in your backend (server/routes.ts) where the freight invoice is stored uses the same filename strategy. Verify that the file indeed exists in the given /uploads/ directory on your server after successful uploads.

Test the Changes
After applying these changes, refresh the table in your application and ensure that the links point to the right places. If the invoice files were uploaded successfully to the /uploads/ directory, the links should work directly.

By following these steps, the freight invoice links in your tables should now reference the uploaded files correctly.
